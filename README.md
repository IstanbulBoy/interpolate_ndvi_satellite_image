# Spline interpolation of NDVI satellite images

## Data
The folder `NDVI/` contains satellite images of NDVI corresponding to
the **h19** and **v8** of the [MODIS Sinusoidal
grid](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/products/modis_products_table/modis_overview). The
page also contains information about the file name, which indicates
the spatial resolution, time resolution and collection dates.



## Script
The `ndvi_interpolation.R` computes the interpolation of the images as
described
